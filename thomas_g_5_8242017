Typing and typing and typing for hours until finally, he was done. Looking up from his work Johnathen was impressed, his new presentation
was complete. After having styed 3 hours past everyone else leaving he was done. It was late 11 pm to be exact and finally his presentation
for his boss was done. Johnathen feeling good about himself checked his email. Shoot! he said under his breath his rent check had not gone 
through. Johnathen in an extremely drowsey state thought nothing about sending back the 750 dollar rent. Little did he no he was being 
phished. Johnathen then woke up in the morning and for a reward he tretated himself to a nice coffee from starbucks. Swiping his card he 
looked down to see two words 'card denied.' What? Johnathen mumbled under his breath he handed the cashier a five dollar bill and rushed outside.
In a panic Johnathen quickly dialed his landlord and asked did you get my rent? The landlord responded "what do you mean? your rent was payed
one week ago." That was all he needed tp hear. John checked his email and tracked down the email sent from the person claiming to be working
for the apartment complex he lived in only to find out that the person who sent the email had encripted the information. How exactly am I 
supposed to recover then money this jerk stole from me. Johnathen went to his friend a grey hat hacker who was able to decript the information
and it was found out to be ghost an infamous phisher who has been known to drive wealthy business men bankrupt. Johnathen then was able to
get all of his money back with a few thousand for compensation and at th eend of the day was happy that this infamous phisher was in jail
and can't anyone anymore.
